Learning-GitHub
===============

Among other things, GitHub is a social network for computer programmers. But GitHub is also a fantastic educational technology. In this series, we'll introduce you to git, the distributed version control system that powers GitHub. We'll show you how to set up an account with GitHub and collaborate with others on projects. You will learn the basics of Markdown, the simple markup language used to communicate on GitHub. We'll talk about the uses of GitHub in the classroom, the sciences, and the digital humanities. We'll even get into advance topics like branching and forking. By the end of the series, you'll be ready to create repositories and collaborate with scholars around the interwebs.
